# Drug Classification using Decision Tree

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts the type of drug a patient should be prescribed based on medical attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and sodium-to-potassium ratio.

A Decision Tree Classifier (entropy criterion) was trained and evaluated, achieving clear classification rules and visual representation of decision paths.
